  ### \`withTheme\` | web | native

  This is a higher order component factory to get the current theme from a \`ThemeProvider\` and
  pass it to your component as a \`theme\` prop.

  ${
    <Table head={[ 'Arguments', 'Description' ]}>
      <Row>
        <Column>
          1. <Code>Component</Code>
        </Column>
        <Column>
          Any valid React component that can handle a <Code>theme</Code> prop.
        </Column>
      </Row>
    </Table>
  }

  Returns the passed component inside a wrapper (higher order component).
  The passed component will receive a \`theme\` prop with the current theme object.

  \`\`\`jsx
  import { withTheme } from 'styled-components'

  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
      console.log('Current theme: ', this.props.theme);
      // ...
    }
  }

  export default withTheme(MyComponent)
  \`\`\`

  Only use this if you need to get the theme as a prop.
  If you just need to set a valid stylesheet property, you can use normal theming for this.
  Check out the section on [Theming](/docs/advanced#theming") to read more on how to use this.

export default WithTheme
