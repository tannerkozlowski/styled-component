## Animations

CSS animations with `@keyframes` aren't scoped to a single component but you still don't want them to be global. This is why we export a `keyframes` and a `css` helper which will generate a unique name for your keyframes. You can then use that unique name throughout your app.
In general, always use the `css` helper when composing styling partials to be interpolated into a styled component,
because then it's possible to lazily inject keyframes and work with code splitting.

This way, you get all the benefits of using JavaScript, are avoiding name clashes and get your keyframes like always:

```react
// keyframes returns a unique keyframe object
const rotate360 = keyframes`
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }

  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
`;

// use the keyframe in a css helper
const rotateAnimation = css`
  ${rotate360} 2s linear infinite
`

// Here we create a component that will rotate everything we pass in over two seconds
const Rotate = styled.div`
  display: inline-block;
  animation: ${rotateAnimation};
  padding: 2rem 1rem;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
`;

render(
  <Rotate>&lt; ðŸ’… &gt;</Rotate>
);
```

> Keyframes are not supported by `react-native`. Instead, use the [`ReactNative.Animated` API](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50891046/rotate-an-svg-in-react-native/50891225#50891225).
